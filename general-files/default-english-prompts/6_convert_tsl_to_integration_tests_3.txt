Thank you!

It's important to emphasize again that you shouldn't reuse elements created in one test in another. For example, you should always create a new user with a different username for each test.

You should generate all tests for all scenarios generated in TSL, without omitting any, and without returning a response asking me to add anything.

Now, generate integration tests for all scenarios in `group: XPTO` on all other endpoints except XYZ.
